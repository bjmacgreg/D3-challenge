          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Income</h2>
          <p>I started trying to add some statistics to this, but it looked like that was going to be a long job. So these
            are simply first impressions, based on one possible set of XY combinations.
          </p>

          <p>Average age in a given state does not appear well correlated with smoking, obesity, or access to health insurance 
            (if that's what "healthcare" is). Utah is stands out as having a young, non-smoking, non-obese population (likely
            due in part to a high proportion of Mormons), while West Virginia is at or near the opposite extreme on all counts.
            High average income appears correlated with lower rates of smoking and obesity, but interestingly not with (what I 
            think is) insurance coverage. A higher poverty rate seems correlated with higher rates of smoking and obesity, 
            as well as with lack of insurance.</p>
